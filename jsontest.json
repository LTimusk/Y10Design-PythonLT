Due to his short stature, dynamic abilities and pace, Giovinco acquired the nickname formica atomica (\"atomic ant\", after the eponymous Hanna-Barbera character) in his youth. In 2015, he was named one of the 100 best footballers in the world by The Guardian, FourFourTwo, and L'Équipe.\r\n\r\nGiovinco began his professional footballing career with Italian club Juventus in Serie B in 2006, where he was promoted to the first team after his success with the club's youth squad; in his first season, he helped the senior side win the title and earn promotion to Serie A, establishing himself as a promising prospect in the number 10 role. After struggling to break into the starting line-up however, he spent successful stints on loan with Italian clubs Empoli and Parma, where he matured as a player, before earning a move back to Juventus in 2012. Upon his return to the Turin club, he won two consecutive league titles, but once again struggled to maintain a spot in the team's starting eleven. This resulted in a high-profile move to MLS side Toronto FC in early 2015, in a deal which made him the league's highest paid player.\r\n\r\nAfter joining the Canadian club, Giovinco soon established himself as one of the best players in the MLS. During his first year with the club, he broke several league records, including the record for most combined goals and assists in a single season, also helping Toronto FC to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs for the first time in the club's history, and winning himself the MLS Golden Boot, the MLS Newcomer of the Year Award, and the MLS MVP Award. In 2016, he won his first title with Toronto FC, the 2016 Canadian Championship, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer, helping the club to qualify for the Playoffs once again, reaching the MLS Cup Final. In 2017, he won his second Canadian Championship, winning the George Gross Memorial Trophy for the best player of the competition, captured the Supporters' Shield, and also won the 2017 MLS Cup with Toronto FC — for a domestic treble. In 2018, Giovinco helped Toronto FC reach the final of the CONCACAF Champions League, and was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player, also capturing his third consecutive Canadian Championship with the club, although Toronto FC failed to qualify for the Playoffs.\r\n\r\nAt international level, Giovinco has represented Italy at all levels since first being called up by the under-16 side in 2003; at youth level, he took part at the 2008 Summer Olympics with the Italian under-23 side, and later helped the Italy under-21 side to the semi-finals of the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. He made his debut with the Italy senior side in 2011, and he later took part at UEFA Euro 2012; winning a runners-up medal, and at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup; winning a bronze medal, and also scoring his first international goal during the tournament.",

On this trip he was the standout player of the Canadian side earning him invitations from clubs such as Southampton.\r\n\r\nProfessional\r\nToronto FC\r\n2008–12: Youth academy and early career\r\nMorgan joined TFC Academy at age 16 in 2008, and went on to feature for the team in the Canadian Soccer League in 2009 and 2010.\r\n\r\nMorgan made his professional debut for Toronto FC on October 20, 2010 in a CONCACAF Champions League match versus Árabe Unido from Panama. Morgan was able to play for the Senior squad of Toronto while not holding a professional contract. The game ended in a 1-0 win for Toronto with Morgan having a stand out performance that earned him much publicity.\r\n\r\nIn late January 2011 it was announced that Morgan would travel with Toronto's Senior team to Turkey for preseason training camp, Ashtone was one of four academy players invited to travel. He signed with Toronto FC on March 17, 2011. Morgan made his league debut on March 26, 2011 against Portland as a second half sub for Javier Martina. In the last third of the season Morgan became a regular starter for the reds with playing a full 90 minutes in 7 of the last 10 league games. Morgan finished the 2011 season with 14 league games.\r\n\r\nMorgan cemented himself as the starting left back for Toronto in the 2012 season, he registered 3 assists in two games in late June. On July 5, the club announced that it had re-signed Morgan to a long term deal.\r\n\r\n2013–Present: Toronto FC and Toronto FC II\r\nHowever, with the arrival of Justin Morrow, Morgan saw his minutes decrease during the 2014 MLS season, mainly featuring as the club's back-up option at left back. With Morrow entrenched at the position going into the 2015 season, Morgan was loaned to Toronto FC II to get more playing time, while still being able to feature for the first team when needed. He made his debut for Toronto FC II against the Charleston Battery on March 21. However, with injuries to the first-team back line, Morgan was able to force his way back into the Toronto line-up during the 2015 season, and on May 2 he became the first player in Toronto FC history to make 100 appearances in all competitions for the club in a 1-0 victory over the Philadelphia Union. Despite missing the majority of the 2016 season due to injury, as Toronto FC made it to the 2016 MLS Cup, Morgan relished the club reaching its most successful season to date. Upon completion of the season, Morgan re-signed with Toronto FC before the 2017 season.\r\n\r\nInternational\r\nMorgan was a part of several Canadian U-16 camps in 2007, while also appearing for the U-20 side in late 2010. Morgan received his first international senior team call-up in late September when Stephen Hart announced his roster for two FIFA World Cup qualifying games against Saint Lucia and Puerto Rico. This made Morgan the first graduate of the Toronto FC Academy to be called up to the Canadian men's national team. Morgan made his debut against Saint Lucia as a second half sub for Simeon Jackson in a 7-0 away victory, he also received an assist for setting up Iain Hume who scored the 6th goal. Morgan was call-up to the national team in the next international window, Ashtone earned his first start for the national team against Saint Kitts and Nevis on November 15, the game ended in a 4-0 victory for the Canadians at the national stadium of BMO Field. On December 13 Morgan was awarded the 2011 Canadian U-20 Player of the Year, receiving 33.3% of the vote and just beating out Russell Teibert for the award.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 2013 Morgan was listed as a part of the confirmed 23-man squad for Colin Miller's Canada squad for 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup.",

He unexpectedly led a winning turnaround with the New York Knicks in 2012, which generated a global craze known as \"Linsanity\". Lin is the first American of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA, and one of the few Asian Americans to play in the league overall. He is also known for his public expression of Christianity.\r\n\r\nLin grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and earned Northern California Player of the Year honors as a senior in high school. After receiving no athletic scholarship offers, he attended Harvard University, where he was a three-time all-conference player in the Ivy League. Undrafted out of college, Lin reached a partially guaranteed contract deal in 2010 with his hometown Golden State Warriors. He seldom played in his rookie season and was assigned to the NBA Development League (D-League) three times. He was waived by the Warriors and the Houston Rockets the following preseason before joining the New York Knicks early in the 2011–12 season.\r\n\r\nIn New York, Lin continued to be played sparingly and again spent time in the D-League. In February 2012, he led a winning streak by New York and was promoted to the starting lineup. In 2012, Lin signed a three-year contract with the Rockets, for whom he played two seasons. He was subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. He played one season with the Lakers before signing with the Charlotte Hornets. He signed with the Brooklyn Nets the following season. Limited to playing in only 37 games over two seasons due to injuries, Lin was traded to the Hawks in 2018, and then joined the Raptors in 2019, after finalizing a buyout with the Hawks.",
